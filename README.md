# User-and-Group-Management-In-linux

The research team at my organization needed to create and manage user accounts, assign them to groups, and control ownership of specific project files. 

This was necessary to ensure that only authorized users had access to sensitive research files. To complete this task, I worked with Linux commands that manage users, groups, and file permissions.

In this project, I worked with Linux commands such as “useradd”,“usermod”, “chown” ,“userdel”, and “grouped”l to create, manage, and remove users, assign them to groups, and control file ownership. 

These steps ensured that sensitive project files were properly secured and that only authorized users had access.
